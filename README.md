# Max Aub: Multimedia Transmediation

The multimedia adaptation of this project is a website where the user explores a soundscape by navigating with the mouse cursor, listening to different binaural audio clips. This experience aims to transport the user through sound into the atmosphere of a crime scene, allowing them to experience the sounds leading up to the moment of the murder.
